== Usage of AssertJ

=== Writing assertions

AssertJ assertions start with a call to assertThat followed by an assertion.

[source, java]
----
assertThat("abc").isEqualTo(123);
----

=== Chaining of assertions

AssertJ allows you to be concise by chaining multiple assertions.

[source, java]
----
// JUnit style
assertNotNull(list);
assertTrue(list.isEmpty());

// AssertJ
assertThat(list).isNotNull().isNotEmpty();
----

=== Assertions for Java collections

AssertJ comes with many built in matchers for core java classes.

Here is an example that tests a Map:

[source, java]
----
// check for multiple keys at once
assertThat(map).containsKeys("a", "b", "c");
// check if the value of a certain key satisfies a condition
assertThat(map).hasEntrySatisfying(key, String::isEmpty);
// check if all entries of an other map are contained in a map
assertThat(map).containsAllEntriesOf(expectedSubset);
----

=== Assertions for Date

AssertJ provides special assertions for the Java date class.

[source, java]
----
assertThat(eclipseOxygen.getReleaseDate()).isBeforeYear(2020).isAfterYear(2016);
assertThat(eclipseOxygen.getReleaseDate()).isBetween("2017-01-31", "2017-12-31");
----

=== Further examples

The following example code is taken from the AssertJ homepage:

[source,java]
----
