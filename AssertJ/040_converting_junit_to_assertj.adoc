== Converting JUnit assertions to AssrtJ with a script

The AssertJ project provides scripts for all major operating systems to automatically convert tests with JUnit assertions to AssertJ.

You can download them from their Github repository:
link:https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/master/src/main/scripts/convert-junit-assertions-to-assertj.sh[Script for Unix/Windows] 
link:https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/master/src/main/scripts/convert-junit-assertions-to-assertj-on-osx.sh[Script for OSX]

Just copy the script into the folder of the tests you want to convert and execute it.

[source, terminal]
----
# Unix/Windows
convert-junit-assertions-to-assertj.sh
# OSX
convert-junit-assertions-to-assertj-on-osx.sh
----

While this script works pretty well it can still introduce compile errors that you have to fix manually.
