== Introduction to AssertJ

The
http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html[AssertJ]
project provides fluent assertion statements for Java. These assert statements are typically used with Java JUnit
tests. AssertJ is a fork of the Fest assert library, as the Fest is not actively
maintained anymore.

AssertJ is a library for simplifying the writing of assert statements in tests. It also improves the readability of
asserts
statements. It has a
fluent interface for assertions.
The
base method for
AssertJ assertions
is the
`assertThat`
method followed by the assertion.
