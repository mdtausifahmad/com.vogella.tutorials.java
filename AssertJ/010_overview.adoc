== Introduction to AssertJ

The http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html[AssertJ] project provides fluent assertion statements for Java.
These assert statements are typically used with Java JUnit tests. 
AssertJ is a fork of the Fest assert library, as the Fest is not actively maintained anymore.

AssertJ is a library for simplifying the writing of assert statements in tests. 
It also improves the readability of asserts statements. 
It has a fluent interface for assertions..
The base method for AssertJ assertions is the `assertThat` method followed by the assertion.
