== Benefits of using AssertJ

This will describe the motivation for using AssertJ instead of plain JUnit asserts.

=== Readability

While JUnit has continually added more assertions in the last years it is st

While you may be familiar with JUnits assertions it is easy for a beginner to mix up `actual` and `expected`.

[source, java]
----
assertEquals(actual, expected);
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);
// this look obviously wrong
assertThat(expected).isEqualTo(actual);
----

It makes it easier to express your intent.

[source, java]
----
Date today = new Date();
assertTrue((birthday.getTime() > today.getTime()));
assertThat(birthday).isBefore(today);
----

=== Better error messages

The specific matcher function not only improve readability but also give the framework the ability to provide you with better error messages.

[source, java]
----
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
assertTrue(list.contains("abc"));
->
java.lang.AssertionError at ...

assertThat(list).contains("abc");
->
java.lang.AssertionError: 
    Expecting:
         <[]>
        to contain:
         <["abc"]>
        but could not find:
         <["abc"]>
