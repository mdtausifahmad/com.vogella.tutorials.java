=== Strings in Java

The
`String`
class represents character strings. All string literals, for example,
"hello", are implemented as instances of this class. An instance of
this class is an object. Strings are immutable, e.g., an assignment
of
a new value to a
`String`
object creates a new object.

[[javastringpool]]
=== String pool in Java

For memory efficiency Java uses a
`String`
pool. The string pool
allows string literals to be reused. This is
possible because
strings in Java are immutable.

If the same string literal is used in several places in the
Java
code, only one copy of that string is created.

Whenever a
`String`
object is created and gets a string literal
assigned, e.g., as in
`String s = "constant"`,
the string pool is used. However, the
`new`
operator forces a new
`String`
copy to be allocated, for example, in
`String s = new String("constant");`.

[[javastringcompare]]
=== Compare Strings in Java

To compare the
`String`
objects
`s1`
and
`s2`,
use the
`s1.equals(s2)`
method.

A
`String`
comparison with
`==`
is incorrect, as
`==`
checks for object reference equality.
`==`
sometimes gives the correct result, as Java uses a
`String`
pool. The
following example would work with
`==`.

This would work as expected.

This comparison would fail.

WARNING:Therefore, you should always use the `equals()` method when you compare strings.

=== Working with Strings
The following lists the most common string operations.

|===
|Command |Description

|`"Testing".equals(text1);`
|Return `true` if `text1`
is equal to `"Testing"`. The check is
case-sensitive.

|`"Testing".equalsIgnoreCase(text1);`
|Return `true` if `text1` is equal to
`"Testing"`. The check is not case-sensitive.
For example, it would also be true for `"testing"`.

|`StringBuffer str1 = new StringBuffer();`
|Define a new
`String`
with a variable length.

|`str.charat(1);`
|Return the character at position 1.
(Note: strings are
arrays of chars starting with 0)

|`str.substring(1);`
|Removes the first characters.

|`str.substring(1, 5);`
|Gets the substring from the second to the fifth
character.

|`str.indexOf("Test")`
|Look for the
`String`
"Test" in String
`str`.
Returns the index of the first
occurrence of the specified
string.

|`str.lastIndexOf("ing")`
|Returns the index of the last occurrence of the
specified
`String`
"ing" in the
`String`
str.
`StringBuffer`
does not support this method.
Hence first
convert the
`StringBuffer`
to
`String`
via method
`toString`.

|`str.endsWith("ing")`
|Returns `true` if `str`
ends with `String` `"ing"`

|`str.startsWith("Test")`
|Returns `true` if
`String`
`str` starts with
`String`
`"Test"`.

|`str.trim()`
|Removes leading and trailing spaces.

|`str.replace(str1, str2)`
|Replaces all occurrences of `str1` by `str2`

|`str2.concat(str1);`
|Concatenates `str1` at the end of `str2`.

|`str.toLowerCase()` / `str.toUpperCase()`
|Converts the string to lower- or uppercase

|`str1 + str2`
|Concatenate `str1` and `str2`

|`String[] array = myString.split("-");` `String[] array2 = myString.split("\\.");`
|Splits the character separated `myString` into an array of strings.
_Attention: the split string is a regular expression,
so if you using special characters which have a meaning in
regular expressions, you need to quote them. In the second
example the . is used and must be quoted by two backslashes._
