=== Strings in Java
		
			The
			`String`
			class represents character strings. All string literals, for example,
			"hello", are implemented as instances of this class. An instance of
			this class is an object. Strings are immutable, e.g., an assignment
			of
			a new value to a
			`String`
			object creates a new object.
		


	<section id="javastringpool">
=== String pool in Java
		
			For memory efficiency Java uses a
			`String`
			pool. The string pool
			allows string literals to be reused. This is
			possible because
			strings in Java are immutable.
		
		
			If the same string literal is used in several places in the
			Java
			code, only one copy of that string is created.
		
		
			Whenever a
			`String`
			object is created and gets a string literal
			assigned, e.g., as in
			`String s = "constant"`,
			the string pool is used. However, the
			`new`
			operator forces a new
			`String`
			copy to be allocated, for example, in
			`
				String s = new String("constant");
			`.
		


	<section id="javastringcompare">
=== Compare Strings in Java
		
			To compare the
			`String`
			objects
			`s1`
			and
			`s2`,
			use the
			`s1.equals(s2)`
			method.
		
		
			A
			`String`
			comparison with
			`==`
			is incorrect, as
			`==`
			checks for object reference equality.
			`==`
			sometimes gives the correct result, as Java uses a
			`String`
			pool. The
			following example would work with
			`==`.
		
		This would work as expected.

		<warning>
			
				Therefore, you should always use the
				`equals()`
				method when you compare strings.

|Command
|Description
						
					
					
						
|
								`"Testing".equals(text1);`
							
|
								Return `true` if `text1`
								is equal to `"Testing"`. The check is
								case-sensitive.
							
						
						
|
								`"Testing".equalsIgnoreCase(text1);`
							
|
								Return `true` if `text1` is equal to
								`"Testing"`. The check is not case-sensitive.
								For example, it would also be true for `"testing"`.
							
						
						
|
								`StringBuffer str1 = new StringBuffer();`
							
|
								Define a new
								`String`
								with a variable length.
							
						
						
|
								`str.charat(1);`
							
|
								Return the character at position 1.
								(Note: strings are
								arrays of chars starting with 0)
							
						
						
|
								`str.substring(1);`
							
|Removes the first characters.
						
						
|
								`str.substring(1, 5);`
							
|
								Gets the substring from the second to the fifth
								character.
							
						
						
|
								`str.indexOf("Test")`
							
|
								Look for the
								`String`
								"Test" in String
								`str`
								.
								Returns the index of the first
								occurrence of the specified
								string.
							
						
						
|
								`str.lastIndexOf("ing")`
							
|
								Returns the index of the last occurrence of the
								specified
								`String`
								"ing" in the
								`String`
								str.
								`StringBuffer`
								does not support this method.
								Hence first
								convert the
								`StringBuffer`
								to
								`String`
								via method
								`toString`.
							
						
						
|
								`str.endsWith("ing")`
							
|
								Returns `true` if `str`
								ends with `String` `"ing"`
							
						
						
|
								`str.startsWith("Test")`
							
|
								Returns `true` if
								`String`
								`str` starts with
								`String`
								`"Test"`.
							
						
						
|
								`str.trim()`
							
|Removes leading and trailing spaces.
						
						
|
								`str.replace(str1, str2)`
							
|Replaces all occurrences of `str1` by `str2`
						
						
|
								`str2.concat(str1);`
							
|Concatenates `str1` at the end of `str2`.
						
						
|
								`str.toLowerCase()`
								/
								`str.toUpperCase()`
							
|Converts the string to lower- or uppercase
						
						
|
								`str1 + str2`
							
|Concatenate `str1` and `str2`
						
						
|
								`String[] array = myString.split("-");`
								`String[] array2 = myString.split("\\.");`
							
|
								Splits the character separated `myString` into an array of strings.
								<emphasis>
									Attention: the split string is a regular expression,
									so if you using special characters which have a meaning in
									regular expressions, you need to quote them. In the second
									example the . is used and must be quoted by two backslashes.
								</emphasis>
