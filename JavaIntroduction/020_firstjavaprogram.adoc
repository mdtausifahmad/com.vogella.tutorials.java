== Exercise: Write, compile and run a Java program

=== Write source code
		
The following Java program is developed under Linux using a text
editor and the command line.
The
process on other operating system
should be similar, but
is not
covered
in this description.
		
Select or create a new directory which will be used for your Java
development. In this description the path
`\home\vogella\javastarter`
is used. On Microsoft Windows
you might want to use
`c:\temp\javastarter`.
This path is
called
_javadir_
in the following description.
		
Open a text editor which supports plain text, e.g.,
_gedit_
under Linux or
_Notepad_
under Windows
and write the following source code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/helloworld/HelloWorld.java[]
----
		
WARNING: Do not use a rich editor like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice for writing Java code. If in doubt, google for "Plain text editor for [your_OS]".

Save the source code in your
_javadir_
directory with the
`HelloWorld.java`
filename. The name of a Java source
file must always equal
the class
name (within the source code)
and end
with the
`.java`
extension. In this example
the
filename must be
`HelloWorld.java`,
because
the
class is called
`HelloWorld`.

=== Compile and run your Java program
		
Open a shell for command line access.
		
TIP: If you don't know how to do this, google for "How to open a shell under [your_OS]".
		
Switch to the
_javadir_
directory with the command
`cd javadir`,
for
example, in the above example
via the
`cd \home\vogella\javastarter`
command.
Use the
`ls`
command (`dir`
under Microsoft Windows) to verify
that
the source file is in the
directory.
		
Compile your Java source file into a class file with the
following command.
		
[source,bourne]
----
include::res/helloworld/compile.sh[]
----
		
Afterwards list again the content of the directory with the
`ls`
or
`dir`
command. The
directory contains now a file
`HelloWorld.class`. If you
see
this
file, you have successfully compiled your first Java source
code
into
bytecode.
		
TIP: By default, the compiler puts each class file in the same directory as its source file. You can specify a separate destination directory with the `-d` compiler flag.

You can now start your compiled Java program. Ensure that you are
still in the
_jardir_
directory and enter the following command to start your Java program.
		
		
[source,bourne]
----
include::res/helloworld/run.sh[]
----
		
The system should write "Hello World" on the command line.

=== Using the classpath
		
You can use the classpath to run the program from another place
in your directory.
		
		
Switch to the command line, e.g., under
menu:Windows Start[Run]
`cmd`.
Switch to any directory you want. Type:
		
[source,bourne]
----
include::res/helloworld/run.sh[]
----
		
If you are not in the directory in which the compiled class is stored, then the system will show an error message:
_Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: test/TestClass_
		
To use the class, type the following command. Replace
"mydirectory" with the directory which contains the test
directory.
You should again see the "HelloWorld" output.

----
include::res/helloworld/classpath.sh[]
