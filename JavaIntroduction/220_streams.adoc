[[streams_definition]]
=== What are streams?

A stream from the `java.util.stream` package is a sequence of elements from a source that supports aggregate operations.

[[stream_intstream]]
=== IntStream
Allow to create a stream of sequence of primitive int-valued elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.

[[lambdas_reduction]]
=== Reduction operations with streams and lambdas
Allow to create a stream of sequence of primitive int-valued elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.

[[lambdas_examples]]
=== Example for filtering and mapping the content of a list

The following example demonstrates how to use streams to filter a list, perform a mapping operation and to create one final result string from it with the `reduce` method.

=== Streams and lambda examples

The following is a larger example for the usage of streams. The code is based on the slides from the
https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2015/session/eclipse-collections-example[Goldmann Sachs Collection presentation at EclipseCOn 2015]

Lets assume the following data model.

[source,java]
----
include::res/stream/PetType.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/stream/Pet.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/stream/Person.java[]
----
With this data model you can use streams and lambdas to filter and search the data as demonstrated in the following example.
