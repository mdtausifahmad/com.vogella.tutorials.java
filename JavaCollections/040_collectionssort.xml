== Using Collections.sort and Comparator in Java
(((Java Collections)))
	
		Sorting a collection in Java is easy, just use the
		`Collections.sort(Collection)`
		to sort your values. The following code shows an example for this.

		This is possible because Integer implements the
		`Comparable`
		interface. This interface defines the method compare which performs
		pairwise comparison of the elements and returns -1
		if the element is
		smaller then the compared element, 0 if it is equal and 1 if it is
		larger.
	
	
		If what to sort differently you can define your custom implementation
		based on the
		`Comparator`
		interface via a lambda expression.

		You can sort by any
		any attribute or
		even
		a combination of attributes. For
		example if you
		have objects of
		type
		`Person`
		with the attributes called
		`income`
		and
		`dataOfBirth`
		you could define different implementations of
		`Comparator`
		and sort the objects according to your needs.
