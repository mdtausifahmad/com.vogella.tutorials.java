== Using Collections.sort and Comparator in Java
(((Java Collections)))
Sorting a collection in Java is easy, just use the
`Collections.sort(Collection)`
to sort your values. The following code shows an example for this.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/sort/Simple.java[]
----
	
This is possible because Integer implements the
`Comparable`
interface. 
This interface defines the method compare which performs pairwise comparison of the elements and returns -1 if the element is smaller than the compared element, 0 if it is equal and 1 if it is larger.
	
If what to sort differently you can define your custom implementation
based on the
`Comparator`
interface via a lambda expression.
	
[source,java]

include::res/sort/ListCustomSorterExample.java[]

You can sort by any
any attribute or
even
a combination of attributes. For
example if you
have objects of
type
`Person`
with the attributes called
`income`
and
`dataOfBirth`
you could define different implementations of
`Comparator`
and sort the objects according to your needs.
