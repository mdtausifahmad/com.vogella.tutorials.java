== RxJava 2.0

=== What is RxJava and reactive programming

In reactive programming the consumer reacts to the data as it comes in.
This is the reason why asynchronous programming is also called reactive programming.
Reactive programming allows to propagates event changes to registered observers.

RxJava is a port from Netflix of the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to Java.
RxJava was open sourced 2014 and is hosted at http://reactivex.io/.

____
The Observer pattern done right.
ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming.

The Java version of this concept is called RxJava and is hosted under https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava.
RxJava is published under the Apache 2.0 license.

RxJava describes itself as an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

=== Define a dependency to RxJava 2.0

As of this writing the version 2.0.4 is currently the released one. 
Replace g.a.v with 2.0.4 or a later version.

For a Gradle build you can add RxJava via the following dependency statement.

[source, groovy]
----
compile group: 'io.reactivex.rxjava2', name: 'rxjava', version: 'g.a.v'
----

For Maven you can add a dependency with the following snippet

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex.rxjava2</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjava</artifactId>
    <version>g.a.v</version>
</dependency>
----

For OSGi environments, e.g., Eclipse RCP development, https://dl.bintray.com/simon-scholz/RxJava-OSGi/ can be used as p2 update site.

=== Async programming

Programming in an imperative single threaded way can lead to blocking user interfaces and therefore a bad user experience.

For example, waiting for a database query or a webservice call can cause an application freeze, if the network is not responsive.

This can be avoided by handling unpredicted things asynchronously. 

An example would be:

[source, java]
----
public List<Todo> getTodos() {
	
	List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a webservice (with bad network latency)
	
	return todosFromDb;
}
----

Calling the `getTodos()` method from the main thread or an UI thread cause the application logic to wait until the `todosFromWeb` arrive.

To improve this long running code should run in a different thread and inform the main thread when a result comes in.

[source, java]
----
public void getTodos(Consumer<List<Todo>> todosCallback) {

	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a webservice

		todosCallback.accept(todosFromWeb);
	});
	thread.start();
}
----

Now after calling the `getTodos(Consumer<List<Todo>> todosConsumer)` the main thread can continue working, is not blocked and can react once the accept method of the given `Consumer` is called.

Now the code is really asynchronous. icon:thumbs-o-up[]

But what if errors during the web service query do occur?

[source, java]
----
public void getTodos(FailableCallback<List<Todo>> todosCallback) {

	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		try {
			List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a web service

			todosCallback.accept(todosFromWeb);
		} catch(Exception ex) {
			todosCallback.error(ex);
		}
	});
	thread.start();
}
----

With the custom `FailableCallback` interface it works, but it also adds complexity.

And there are even more issue that can occur:

* Synchronization with the UI (Widgets in SWT and Android have to be updated from the UI thread)
* What if the consumer of the `FailableCallback` is not present any more?
* What if such a `FailableCallback` depends on another `FailableCallback`?

[source, java]
----

public void getUserPermission(FailableCallback<UserPermission> permissionCallback) {
	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		try {
			UserPermission permission = // query a web service

			permissionCallback.accept(permission);
		} catch(Exception ex) {
			permission.error(ex);
		}
	});
	thread.start();
}

public void getTodos(FailableCallback<List<Todo>> todosCallback) {

	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		getUserPermission(new FailableCallback() {

			public void accept(UserPermission permission) {
				if(permission.isValid()) {
					try {
						List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a web service

						if(!todosCallbackInstance.isDisposed()) {
							if(syncWithUIThread()) {
								todosCallback.accept(todosFromWeb);
							}
						}
					} catch(Exception ex) {
						if(!todosCallbackInstance.isDisposed()) {
							if(syncWithUIThread()) {
								todosCallback.error(ex);
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
			
			public void error(Exception ex) {
				// Oh no!
			}
		});
	});
	thread.start();
}

This is really bad coding and it could get worse and should only show one example what can be addressed with ReactiveX. These problems are often considered as _callback hell_.
