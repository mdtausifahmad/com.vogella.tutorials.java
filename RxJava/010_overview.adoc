== Using reactive programming with RxJava 2.0

=== What is RxJava and reactive programming

In reactive programming the consumer reacts to the data as it comes in.
This is the reason why asynchronous programming is also called reactive programming.
Reactive programming allows to propagates event changes to registered observers.

RxJava is a port from Netflix of the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to Java.
RxJava was open sourced 2014 and is hosted at http://reactivex.io/.

____
The Observer pattern done right.
ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming.
____

The Java version of this concept is called RxJava and is hosted under https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava.
RxJava is published under the Apache 2.0 license.

RxJava describes itself as an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.


The build blocks for RxJava code are the following:

* *observables* representing sources of data
* *subscribers (or observers)* listening to the observables
* a set of methods for modifying and composing the data

An observable emits items; a subscriber consumes those items. 
An observable may emit any number of items (including zero items).
It can terminate either successfully or with an error.

A observable can have any number of subscribers.
If a new item is emitted from the observable, the `onNext()` method is called on each subscriber.
If the observable finishes its data flow either successful or with an error, the `onComplete()` or the `onError()` method is called on each subscriber.

A very simple example written as JUnit4 test is the following:

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.android.rxjava.simple;

import org.junit.Test;

import io.reactivex.Observable;

import static junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue;


public class RxJavaUnitTest {
    String result="";

    // Simple subscription to a fix value
    @Test
    public void returnAValue(){
        result = "";
        Observable<String> observer = Observable.just("Hello"); // provides datea
        observer.subscribe(s -> result=s); // Callable as subscriber
        assertTrue(result.equals("Hello"));
    }
}
----

=== Define a dependency to RxJava 2.0

As of this writing the version 2.0.4 is currently the released one. 
Replace the version with your desired version.s

For a Gradle build you can add RxJava via the following dependency statement.

[source, groovy]
----
compile group: 'io.reactivex.rxjava2', name: 'rxjava', version: '2.0.4'
----

For Maven you can add a dependency with the following snippet

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.reactivex.rxjava2</groupId>
    <artifactId>rxjava</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.4</version>
</dependency>
----

For OSGi environments, e.g., Eclipse RCP development, https://dl.bintray.com/simon-scholz/RxJava-OSGi/ can be used as p2 update site.

=== Why doing asynchronous programming

Programming in an imperative single threaded way can lead to blocking user interfaces.
For example, waiting for a webservice call can cause an application freeze, if the network is not responsive.
Such behavior results in a bad experience for the user.


This can be avoided by handling potential long running operations asynchronously. 

An example would be:

[source, java]
----
public List<Todo> getTodos() {
	List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a webservice (with bad network latency)
	return todosFromWeb;
}
----

Calling the `getTodos()` method from the main thread cause the application logic to wait until the `todosFromWeb` arrive.

To improve this potential long running code should run in a different thread.
It should post updates to the main thread when a result comes in.

[source, java]
----
public void getTodos(Consumer<List<Todo>> todosCallback) {

	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a webservice

		todosCallback.accept(todosFromWeb);
	});
	thread.start();
}
----

Now after calling the `getTodos(Consumer<List<Todo>> todosConsumer)` the main thread can continue working, is not blocked and can react once the accept method of the given `Consumer` is called.
This code runs now asynchronous. icon:thumbs-o-up[]

But what if errors during the web service query do occur?

[source, java]
----
public void getTodos(FailableCallback<List<Todo>> todosCallback) {

	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		try {
			List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a web service

			todosCallback.accept(todosFromWeb);
		} catch(Exception ex) {
			todosCallback.error(ex);
		}
	});
	thread.start();
}
----

With the custom `FailableCallback` interface it works, but it also adds complexity.

And there are even more issue that can occur:

* Synchronization with the main thread may be required (For example, widgets in SWT and Android have to be updated from the UI thread)
* What if the consumer of the `FailableCallback` is not present any more?
* What if such a `FailableCallback` depends on another `FailableCallback`?

[source, java]
----

public void getUserPermission(FailableCallback<UserPermission> permissionCallback) {
	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		try {
			UserPermission permission = // query a web service

			permissionCallback.accept(permission);
		} catch(Exception ex) {
			permission.error(ex);
		}
	});
	thread.start();
}

public void getTodos(FailableCallback<List<Todo>> todosCallback) {

	Thread thread = new Thread(()-> {
		getUserPermission(new FailableCallback() {

			public void accept(UserPermission permission) {
				if(permission.isValid()) {
					try {
						List<Todo> todosFromWeb = // query a web service

						if(!todosCallbackInstance.isDisposed()) {
							if(syncWithUIThread()) {
								todosCallback.accept(todosFromWeb);
							}
						}
					} catch(Exception ex) {
						if(!todosCallbackInstance.isDisposed()) {
							if(syncWithUIThread()) {
								todosCallback.error(ex);
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
			
			public void error(Exception ex) {
				// Oh no!
			}
		});
	});
	thread.start();
}
----


This is really bad coding and hard to read code.
Also having lots of callbacks can lead to what is known as the http://callbackhell.com/[callbackhell].
This can be better addressed with RxJava.

=== Advantages of RxJava 

Some advantages of RxJava are the following:

* You can chain async operations, e.g., if a API call depends on the call of another API
* A defined way to handle errors
* It reduces the need for state variables, which can be the source of errors
