== Testing with mock objects

===	Target and challenge of unit testing
		
A unit test should test a class in isolation. 
Side effects from other classes or the system should be eliminated if possible.
To eliminate these side effects you have to replace dependencies to other classes.
This can be done via using replacements for the real dependencies.		
		
		
=== Classifications of different test classes
(((Test doubles)))
(((Mock objects)))
(((Stub objects)))
(((Fake objects)))
(((Dummy objects)))
A _dummy object_ is passed around but never used, i.e., its methods are never called.
Such an object can for example be used to fill the parameter list of a method.
		
_Fake_ objects have working implementations, but are usually simplified.
For example, they use an in memory database and not a real database.
			
A _stub_ class is an partial implementation for an interface or class with the purpose of using an instance of this stub class during testing. 
Stubs usually don't respond to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
Stubs may also record information about calls.
		
A _mock object_ is a dummy implementation for an interface or a class in which you define the output of certain method calls.
Mock objects can be configured to expect a certain behavior during a test, eg., how often and with which values a certain method is expected to be called.
While this can be a useful feature, it also introduces additional coupling between test and production code and should be used with caution.
		
Test doubles can be passed to other objects which are tested. 
Your tests can validate that the class reacts correctly during tests.
For example, you can validate if certain methods on the mock object were called. 
This helps to ensure that you only test the class while running tests and that your tests are not affected by any side effects.
		
Mock objects are typically configured. 
Mock objects typically require less code to configure and should therefore be preferred.
		

=== Mock object generation
		
You can create mock objects manually (via code) or use a mock framework to simulate these classes. 
Mock frameworks allow you to create mock objects at runtime and define their behavior.
		
The classical example for a mock object is a data provider. 
In production an implementation to connect to the real data source is used.
But for testing a mock object simulates the data source and ensures that the test conditions are always the same.
		
These mock objects can be provided to the class which is tested.
Therefore, the class to be tested should avoid any hard dependency on external data.
		
Mocking or mock frameworks allows testing the expected interaction with the mock object. 
You can, for example, validate that only certain methods have been called on the  mock object.

=== Using Mockito for mocking objects
    
_Mockito_ is a popular mock framework which can be used in conjunction with JUnit.
Mockito allows you to create and configure mock objects. 
Using Mockito simplifies the development of tests for classes with external dependencies significantly.

If you use Mockito in tests you typically:

* Mock away external dependencies and insert the mocks into the code under test
* Execute the code under test
* Validate that the code executed correctly
