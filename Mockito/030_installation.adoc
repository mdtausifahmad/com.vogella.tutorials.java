Search for g:"org.mockito", a:"mockito-core" via the http://search.maven.org website to	find the correct pom entry.
		
[[mockito_installation_eclipse]]
=== Using the Eclipse IDE

The Eclipse IDE supports Gradle as well as Maven.
Mockito does not provide a "all" download in its latest version.
Therefore you are advised to use either the Gradle or Maven tooling in Eclipse.

The Orbit repositories are a good source for third party libraries, which can be used in Eclipse based applications or plug-ins.
