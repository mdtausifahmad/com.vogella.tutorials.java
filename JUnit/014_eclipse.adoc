== Eclipse support for JUnit

[[eclipse_creatingjunittest]]
=== Creating JUnit tests
(((JUnit,Creating tests in Eclipse)))

You can write the JUnit tests manually, but Eclipse supports the creation of JUnit tests via wizards.
		
For example, to create a JUnit test or a test class for an existing class.
Right-click on your new class, select this class in the Package Explorer_ view, right-click on it
and select menu:New[JUnit Test Case].
		
Alternatively you can also use the JUnit wizards available under menu:File[New >Other... > Java >JUnit].
		
=== Running JUnit tests

The Eclipse IDE also provides support for executing your tests interactively.

To run a test, select the test class , right-click on it and select menu:Run-as[JUnit Test]. 

This starts JUnit and executes all test methods in this class.

Eclipse provides the kbd:[Alt + Shift + X], kbd:[T] shortcut to run the test in the selected class. 

To run only the selected test, position the cursor on the test method name and use the shortcut.

To see the result of a JUnit test, Eclipse uses the _JUnit_ view which shows the results of the tests. 
You can also select individual unit tests in this view, right-click on them and select _Run_ to execute them again.

By default, this view shows all tests.
You can also configure, that it only shows failing tests.

You can also define that the view is only activated if you have a failing test.

NOTE:Eclipse creates run configurations for tests. You can see and modify these via the
menu:Run[Run Configurations...] menu.

=== Extracting the failed test and stacktraces
		
To get the list of failed test,	right click on the test result and select
_Copy Failure List_. This copies the failed tests and there stack traces into the clipboard.

[[usingjunit_staticimports]]
=== JUnit static imports
(((JUnit,Static imports in Eclipse)))
		
Static import is a feature that allows fields and methods defined in a class as `public static` to be used without specifying the class in which the field is defined.
		
		
JUnit assert statements are typically defined as `public static` to allow the developer to write short test statements. 
The following snippet demonstrates an assert statement with and without static imports.

[[usingjunit_testsuites]]
=== Wizard for creating test suites
		
You can create a test suite via Eclipse.
For this, select the test classes which should be included in suite in the _Package Explorer_ view, right-click on them and select menu:New[Other... > JUnit > JUnit Test Suite].

[[usingjunit_execption]]
=== Testing exception
(((JUnit,Exceptions)))
		
The `@Test (expected = Exception.class)` annotation is limited as it can only test for one exception. 
To testexceptions, you can use the following testpattern.

include::res/example/TestException.java[]

[[usingjunit_plugintest]]
=== JUnit Plug-in Test
(((JUnit Plug-in Test)))
(((Plug-in Test)))

JUnit Plug-in tests are used to write unit tests for your plug-ins.
These tests are executed by a special test runner that launches another Eclipse instance in a separate VM. 
The test methods are executed within that instance.
