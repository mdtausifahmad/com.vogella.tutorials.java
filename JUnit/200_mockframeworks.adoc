== Mocking
	
Unit testing also makes use of object mocking. In this case the real
object is exchanged by a replacement which has a predefined behavior
for the test.
	
There are several frameworks available for mocking. 
To learn more about mock frameworks please see the Mockito tutorial under http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Mockito/article.html
