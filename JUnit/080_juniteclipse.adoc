== Exercise: Using JUnit

=== Project preparation
		
Create a new project called
_com.vogella.junit.first_.
Create a new source
folder
_test_. For this
right-click on your
project,
select
_Properties_
and choose
menu:Java[Build Path].
Select the _Source_ tab.

NOTE:You can also add a new source folder by right-clicking on a project and selecting menu:New[Source Folder].

=== Create a Java class
		
In the _src_ folder, create the `com.vogella.junit.first` package and the following class.

[source, java]
----
include::res/first/MyClass.java[]
----

=== Create a JUnit test
		
Right-click on your new class in the
_Package Explorer_
view
and select
menu:New[JUnit Test Case].

In the following wizard
ensure that the
_New JUnit 4 test_
flag
is selected
and set the source folder to
_test_,
so
that your test class gets created in this folder.

If the JUnit library is not part of the classpath of your
project, Eclipse
will
prompt you to add it. Use this to add JUnit to
your project.

Create a test with the following code.

[source, java]
----
include::res/first/MyClassTest.java[]
----

=== Run your test in Eclipse

Right-click on your new test class and select
menu:Run-As[JUnit Test].

The result of the tests are displayed in the JUnit
view. In
our example one test should be successful and one test should
show an
error. This error is indicated by a red bar.

The test is failing,
because our multiplier class is
currently not
working
correctly. It
does a
division instead of
multiplication. Fix the
bug
and re-run the
test to get
a green bar.
