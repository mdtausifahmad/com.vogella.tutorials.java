== Improvements and issues with concurrency

=== Limits of concurrency gains
		
Within a Java application you work with several threads to
achieve parallel processing or asynchronous behavior.
Concurrency promises to perform certain task faster as these
tasks can
be divided into subtasks and these subtasks can
be executed
in parallel. Of course the runtime is limited by parts of
the task
which can be performed in parallel.
		
The theoretical possible
performance gain can be
calculated by the following rule
which is referred to as
_Amdahl's Law_.
		
If F is the percentage of the program which can not run in parallel and N is the number of processes, then the maximum performance gain is 1 / (F+ \((1-F)/n)).
		
=== Concurrency issues

Threads have their own call stack, but can also access shared
data. Therefore you have two basic problems,
visibility and access
problems.
		
A visibility problem occurs if thread A reads shared data which
is later changed by thread B and thread A is
unaware of this
change.
		
An access problem can occur if several thread access and
change
the same shared data at the same time.
		
Visibility and access problem can lead to

* Liveness failure: The program does not react anymore due to problems in the concurrent access of data, e.g. deadlocks.
* Safety failure: The program creates incorrect data.
