== Spring Overview
	 The Spring Framework is a very comprehensive framework.
	 The fundamental functionality provided by the Spring Container
		is dependency injection. Spring provides a light-weight container,
		e.g. the Spring core container, for dependency injection (DI).
	 This container allows to inject required objects into other
		objects. This results in a design in which the Java class are not
		hard-coupled. The injection in Spring is either done via setter
		injection of via construction injection.
	These classes which are managed by Spring must conform to
		the JavaBean standard.
	In the context of Spring classes are also referred to as beans
		or as spring beans.
	
		The Spring core container:
		
			*handles the configuration, generally based on
					annotations or on an XML file (XMLBeanFactory)

			*manages the selected Java classes via the BeanFactory
				

		</itemizedlist>
		 The core container uses the so-called bean factory to create
			new objects. New objects are generally created as Singletons if not
			specified differently.
