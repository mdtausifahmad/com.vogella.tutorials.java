== Dependency Injection
	 Java components / classes should be as independent as possible
		of other Java classes. This increases the possibility to reuse these
		classes and to test them independently of other classes(Unit Testing).
		To decouple Java components from other Java components the dependency
		to a certain other class should get injected into them rather that the
		class itself creates / finds this object.
	 A class A has a dependency to class B if class uses class B as a
		variable.
	
		If dependency injection is used then the class B is given to class A
		via
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				the constructor of the class A - this is then called
					construction injection
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				a setter - this is then called setter injection
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	
	 The general concept between dependency injection is called
		Inversion of Control. A class should not configure itself but should
		be configured from outside.
	 A design based on independent classes / components increases the
		re-usability and possibility to test the software. For example if a
		class A expects a Dao (Data Access object) for receiving the data from
		a database you can easily create another test object which mocks the
		database connection and inject this object into A to test A without
		having an actual database connection.
	 A software design based on dependency injection is possible with
		standard Java.
	 Spring just add some simplifications in using dependency
		injection by providing a standard way of providing the configuration
		and by managing the reference to the created objects.
