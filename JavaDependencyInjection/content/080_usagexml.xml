== Using dependency injection with XML
	 The following example will demonstrate the usage of the
		dependency injection via xml. The example code demonstrates how to
		injects a writer into
		another class.
	
	 Create a new Java project "de.vogella.spring.di.xml.first" and
		include the minimal required spring jars into your classpath.
	
	Copy your model class from the de.vogella.spring.di.model
		project
		into this project.
	
	 Under the src folder create a folder META-INF and create the
		following file in this folder. This is the Spring configuration file.
	
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/xml/beans.xml[]
----
	
	 Again, you can now wire the application together. Create a main
		class which reads the configuration file and starts the application.
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/xml/Main.java[]
