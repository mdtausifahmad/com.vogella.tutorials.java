== Java Persistence API (JPA)

[[jpaintro_overview]]
=== Overview

The process of mapping Java objects to
database tables and vice
versa is
called "Object-relational mapping"
(ORM).
		
The Java
Persistence API (JPA) is one possible approach to ORM.
JPA is a
specification and
several
implementations
are
available. Popular
implementations are Hibernate, EclipseLink and Apache OpenJPA. The
reference implementation of
JPA is EclipseLink.
		
Via JPA the
developer
can
map, store,
update and
retrieve data from
relational
databases to
Java
objects and vice versa.
		
JPA permits the developer to
work directly
with
objects rather
then
with
SQL
statements. The JPA implementation is
typically
called
persistence provider. JPA can be used in Java-EE and Java-SE
applications.
		
The mapping between Java objects and database tables is
defined
via
persistence metadata.
The JPA provider will use
the persistence
metadata
information
to
perform
the correct database operations.
		
JPA typically
defines the
metadata via annotations in
the Java
class.
Alternatively
the metadata can be defined vian
XML or
a
combination of both. A XML
configuration
overwrites the
annotations.
		
The following description will be based on the usage of
annotations.

JPA defines a SQL-like Query language for static
and
dynamic
queries.
		
Most JPA persistence provider offer the option to create
automatically the database schema based on the
metadata.

[[jpaintro_entity]]
=== Entity
		
A class which should be persisted in a database it must be
annotated
with
`javax.persistence.Entity`. Such a class is called
`Entity`. 
JPA will create a table for the entity in your database.
Instances
of the class will be a row in the table.
		
All entity classes must define a primary key, must have a
non-arg
constructor and or not allowed to be final. Keys
can be a
single
field
or a combination of fields.
		
JPA allows to auto-generate the primary key
in the database via the
`@GeneratedValue`
annotation.
		
By default, the table
name
corresponds to the class name. You can
change this with the
addition
to the annotation
@Table(name="NEWTABLENAME").

[[jpaintro_fields]]
=== Persistence of fields
		
The fields of the Entity will be saved in the database. JPA can use
either your instance variables (fields) or the
corresponding getters
and setters to access the fields. You are not allowed to mix both
methods. If you want to use the
setter and getter methods the Java
class must follow the Java Bean naming conventions. JPA persists per
default all
fields of an Entity, if fields should not be saved they
must be marked with
`@Transient`.
		
By default each field is mapped to a column with the name of
the
field. You can change the default name via
`@Column`
(name="newColumnName").
		
The following annotations can be used.

.Annotations for fields / getter and setter
|===
|@Id |Identifies the unique ID of the database entry

|@GeneratedValue
|Together with an ID this annotation defines that this value is generated automatically.

|@Transient
|Field will not be saved in database

[[jpaintro_relationships]]
=== Relationship Mapping

JPA allows to define relationships between classes, e.g. it can
be defined that a class is part of another class
(containment).
Classes can
have one to one, one to many, many to one, and many to
many
relationships with other classes.
		
A relationship can be bidirectional or unidirectional, e.g. in
a bidirectional relationship both classes store a
reference to each
other while in an unidirectional case only one class has a reference
to the other class. Within a
bidirectional relationship you need to
specify the
owning side of this relationship in the other class with
the
attribute "mappedBy", e.g.
@ManyToMany(mappedBy="attributeOfTheOwningClass".

Relationship annotations:

* @OneToOne
* @OneToMany
* @ManyToOne
* @ManyToMany

[[jpaintro_entitymanager]]
=== Entity Manager
		
The entity manager
`javax.persistence.EntityManager`
provides the operations from and to the database, e.g.
find objects,
persists them, remove objects from the
database,
etc.

In a JavaEE
application the entity manager is automatically
inserted in the web
application. Outside JavaEE you need
to
manage the entity manager
yourself.
		
Entities which are managed by an Entity Manager will
automatically propagate these changes to the database (if
this
happens within a commit statement). If the Entity Manager is closed
(via close()) then the managed entities are in
a detached state. If
synchronize them again with the database a Entity Manager provides
the merge() method.
		
The
_persistence context_
describes all Entities of one Entity manager.

[[jpaintro_persistenceunits]]
=== Persistence units
		
The
`EntityManager`
is created by the
`EntityManagerFactory`
which is configured by the persistence unit. The persistence unit is
described via the
`persistence.xml`
file in the
`META-INF`
directory of
the source folder. A set of entities
which are logical
connected will
be grouped via a persistence unit.
The `persistence.xml` file defines the connection data to the database, e.g. the driver, the user and the password.
