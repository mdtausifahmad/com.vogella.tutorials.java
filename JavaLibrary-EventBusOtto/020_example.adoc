== Exercise: Using Otto the event bus system

This is an example for the usage of Otto in an Android application.

Create a new Android project called `com.vogella.java.library.otto` based on the `Empty Activity with Fragment` template.


Add the dependency to the `build.gradle` file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/build.gradle[]
----

The `activity_main.xml` layout file of the activity should look like the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/activity_main.xml[]
----

The `fragment_main.xml` layout file of the fragment should look like the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragment_main.xml[]
----

Add an fragment and add it dynamically to your activity.
Send an event from the fragment to the activity and vice versa.
Display in both case a `Toast`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/MainActivity.java[]
----

NOTE: The example is intentional simple. 
In a real Android application you would created the `Bus` singleton in the  `Application` class.
