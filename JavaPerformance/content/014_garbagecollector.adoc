== Garbage Collector
	 The JVM automatically re-collects the memory which is not used
		any more. The memory for objects which are not referred any more will
		be automatically released by the garbage collector.
	To see then the garbage collector starts working add the
		command line argument "-verbose:gc" to your virtual machine.
