== Memory settings for Java virtual machine

The JVM runs with fixed available memory. Once this memory is
exceeded
you will receive "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError". The JVM tries to
make an
intelligent choice about the available memory at startup (see
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html[Java settings]
for details) but you can overwrite the default with the following
settings.

To turn performance you can use certain parameters in the JVM.

.JVM parameters
|===

|Parameter |Description

|-Xms1024m
|Set the minimum available memory for the JVM to 1024 Megabyte

|-Xmx1800m
|Set the maximum available memory for the JVM to 1800 Megabyte. 
The Java application cannot use more heap memory then defined via this parameter. 

|===

TIP: Increase the values in these parameters to avoid the following
error: "Exception in thread java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap
space". Note that you cannot allocate more memory then you have
physically available.

If you start your Java program from the command line use for
example the following setting: java -Xmx1024m YourProgram. 
In Eclipse
your can use the VM arguments in the run configuration.
