[[lazyinit]]
== Lazy initialization

In case a variable is very expensive to create then sometimes it is good to defer the creation of this variable until the variable is needed. 
This is called lazy initialization.
In general lazy initialization should only be used if a analysis has proven that this is really a very expensive operations. 
This is based on the fact that lazy initialization makes it more difficult to read the code.
I use the project "de.vogella.performance.lazyinitialization" for the examples in this chapter. And a have a own field defined.

[[lazyinit_synchronized]]
=== Concurrency - Overview

The simplest way is to use a synchronized block. 
Because then field access is always synchronized in case on read access this variant is slow.
