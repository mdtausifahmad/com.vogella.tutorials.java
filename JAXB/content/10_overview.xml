== Overview
	 Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) is a Java standard that
		defines how Java objects are
		converted from and to XML. It uses a
		standard set of mappings.
	
	
		JAXB defines an API for reading and
		writing Java objects to
		and
		from
		XML documents.
	
	As JAXB is defined via a specification, it is possible to use
		different implementations for this standard. JAXB
		defines a
		service
		provider
		which
		allows the
		selection of the JAXB
		implementation.
	
	
		It applies
		a lot of
		defaults thus
		making reading and
		writing
		of XML
		via
		Java
		relatively easy.
